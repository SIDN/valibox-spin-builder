Changelog:

1.11
- Updated OpenWRT to 21.02.0
- Valibox firmware upgrade functionality has been ported to Luci
- Added a Luci configuration screen for SPIN
- Added an initial version of the Bridge mode on the gl-ar150 version
- Replace image for Raspberry Pi 3 by image for Raspberry Pi 4
- Updated SPIN to 1.0:
  * Added support for bridge mode, where SPIN is not running on an access point,
    but as a bump in the wire
  * Spinweb now shows some suggestions on what could be wrong when it is
    unable to connect to the MQTT server
  * Added support for TLS (and wss) in spinweb
  * Added option to enable HTTP authentication in spinweb
  * Added support for mosquitto user authentication in spinweb
  * Updated the vis library in the bubble app
  * Improved logging options, spind can now log to syslog, file, and standard out,
    and log to multiple targets simultaneously
  * Reduced traffic exchanged between PCAP reader and spind by aggregating
    information before sending it
  * Added support for network communication between PCAP reader and spind
  * Bugfixes
    - Fixed issue in call to mkstemp() (https://github.com/SIDN/spin/issues/77)
    - Fixed several small issues in the PCAP reader connection code core2ext
    - Fixed issue with spinweb query parameter mqtt_port
      (https://github.com/SIDN/spin/issues/79)
    - Fixed a number of issues with the generated mosquitto configuration when
      spind runs its own instance of mosquitto
    - Fixed the issue where tcpdump could fail until router was rebooted
    - Improved cleanup routines when SPIN fails to start

1.10
- Updated Unbound to 1.13
- Updated OpenWRT to 19.07.5
- Updated SPIN to 0.12
  * SPIN is now, by default, directly reachable on port 13026, rather that
    needing a reverse proxy for handling web traffic. It is still advisable
    to set one up yourself, to add TLS support and other security.
  * Added the SPIN Pcap Reader functionality
  * Added a 'passive mode', where SPIN does not modify firewall rules
  * The 'bubble app' now shows labels edges with the services or destination
    ports of the traffic, such as 'ntp' or 'https'. This is based on the
    destination port number, and SPIN does not inspect whether the traffic
    actually matches the service. For instance, all traffic on port 443 is
    shown as 'https'.
  * Replaced the lua-based web API to control the SPIN daemon with an
    internal libmicrohttpd-based implementation. This eases initial
    configuration and reduces the dependencies of the package, while
    still allowing optional additional security features through a
    (manually configured) http frontend such as nginx or apache
  * Improved the pcap upload screen. It now shows more data fields, as well
    as suggested entries.
  * SPIN can now automatically start mosquitto if necessary
  * SPIN can now automatically load conntrack kernel modules and enable
    IP Accounting
  * Fixed a compilation issue when using Clang


1.9
- Updated OpenWRT to 19.07.0
- Small improvement of valibox page CSS
- Updated SPIN to 0.11:
  * Added '-c' option to spind for specifying a configuration file
  * Added '-e' option to spind for specifying an external traffic data input socket
  * Added experimental DOTS signal message processing (disabled by default)
  * Added small command-line tool to send DOTS signal messages
  * Device flow data now includes port numbers and ICMP types
  * Fixed an issue where spind would crash if the logfile can't be opened
  * Fixed an issue where clicking on empty space in the Web UI showed an error
  * Fixed an issue where traffic captures would time out


1.8
- Added time.nl to the list of NTP servers
- Updated OpenWRT to 18.06.4
- Updated SPIN to 0.10:
  * The MQTT Traffic channel protocol has changed; node information is now sent in a separate subchannel,
  and flow information uses node id's instead of the full node data
  * Added RPC functionality: some information and functionality can now directly be accessed. If UBUS is
  available, SPIN uses that. Otherwise, it will listen for JSON-RPC commands on /var/run/spin_rpc.sock.
  An overview of the RPC methods can be requested by the RPC method 'list_rpc_methods'
  * The web API now provides and endpoint for all RPC methods as JSON-RPC
  * The SPIN/commands channel is no longer used for interactive commands, and all functionality in spind
  handling commands here has been replaced by the RPC mechanism
  * The bubble app now uses the web API rpc endpoint for commands and direct information retrieval (except
  traffic data). This improves performance and reliability, but it does mean that both spind and
  spin_webui must be running.
  * 'Most recent flows' information can now be retrieved for devices on the network
  * SPIN (and the bubble app) now provide functionality to block traffic between two specific nodes (in
  addition to the existing 'all traffic from and to one node').
  * Added an 'extsrc' source, where pcap data can be sent to SPIN directly
  * The 'mqtt_host' on the bubble app now defaults to the host of the app itself
  * Bugfixes and refactoring: see the git repository for details
