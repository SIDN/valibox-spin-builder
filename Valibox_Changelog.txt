Changelog:

1.9
- Updated OpenWRT to 19.07.0
- Small improvement of valibox page CSS
- Updated SPIN to 0.11:
  * Added '-c' option to spind for specifying a configuration file
  * Added '-e' option to spind for specifying an external traffic data input socket
  * Added experimental DOTS signal message processing (disabled by default)
  * Added small command-line tool to send DOTS signal messages
  * Device flow data now includes port numbers and ICMP types
  * Fixed an issue where spind would crash if the logfile can't be opened
  * Fixed an issue where clicking on empty space in the Web UI showed an error
  * Fixed an issue where traffic captures would time out


1.8
- Added time.nl to the list of NTP servers
- Updated OpenWRT to 18.06.4
- Updated SPIN to 0.10:
  * The MQTT Traffic channel protocol has changed; node information is now sent in a separate subchannel,
  and flow information uses node id's instead of the full node data
  * Added RPC functionality: some information and functionality can now directly be accessed. If UBUS is
  available, SPIN uses that. Otherwise, it will listen for JSON-RPC commands on /var/run/spin_rpc.sock.
  An overview of the RPC methods can be requested by the RPC method 'list_rpc_methods'
  * The web API now provides and endpoint for all RPC methods as JSON-RPC
  * The SPIN/commands channel is no longer used for interactive commands, and all functionality in spind
  handling commands here has been replaced by the RPC mechanism
  * The bubble app now uses the web API rpc endpoint for commands and direct information retrieval (except
  traffic data). This improves performance and reliability, but it does mean that both spind and
  spin_webui must be running.
  * 'Most recent flows' information can now be retrieved for devices on the network
  * SPIN (and the bubble app) now provide functionality to block traffic between two specific nodes (in
  addition to the existing 'all traffic from and to one node').
  * Added an 'extsrc' source, where pcap data can be sent to SPIN directly
  * The 'mqtt_host' on the bubble app now defaults to the host of the app itself
  * Bugfixes and refactoring: see the git repository for details
